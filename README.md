# 4005-Lab-Format
This is a class to use latex to write the ME Lab reports with minimal formatting This class extendes texMemo by Rob Oakes by adding \address command There is no license for this class. Becareful with tables, lots of weird stuff happens with them. To use, with overleaf, bring in all the files except the readme to the overleaf workspace. Main.tex is an example code for Latex but does not go over everything. Dont Modify the .cls file.

Tables are special and a pain in the ass. use https://www.tablesgenerator.com/
Make sure to pay attention to the options. I have loaded lscape, longtable in the class

To use with overleaf not as an example, make a new project, then add a file, choose external source. Use this link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bao-create/4005-Lab-Format/master/MeLabtexMemo.cls
